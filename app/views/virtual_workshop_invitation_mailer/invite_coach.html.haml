                  Our next virtual #{@workshop.chapter.name} workshop is coming soon, and we’d like to invite you to join us as a coach

                %p You will be helping students remotely as they work their way through one of our tutorials or a personal project they need help with. Not to worry, you’ll only be matched with students who you’ll be able to help based on your experience and expertise.

                %p You can find all of our tutorials at #{link_to 'http://tutorials.codebar.io/', 'http://tutorials.codebar.io/'}. If you have any suggestions to improve our existing content, you can issue a pull request to our #{link_to 'GitHub repository', 'https://github.com/codebar/tutorials'}

                %p Before the workshop takes place, make sure that you have read and understood our #{link_to 'Code of Conduct', 'http://codebar.io/code-of-conduct'}. We have a zero tolerance policy towards negative conduct and expect everyone to behave appropriately. You should also go through our guide on #{link_to 'How to be an effective teacher.', 'http://codebar.io/effective-teacher-guide'}.

                %p Please note: We do not accept any RSVPs over email.

                %p.callout #{link_to 'Join us on Slack', 'https://slack.codebar.io'} to offer help and guidance outside the workshops.
